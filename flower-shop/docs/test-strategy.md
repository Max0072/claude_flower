# Test Strategy for Flora Online Flower Shop

## 1. Test Approach Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Flora online flower shop application. The strategy covers all levels of testing from unit tests to end-to-end testing, as well as performance, security, and accessibility testing.

## 2. Testing Levels

### 2.1. Unit Testing

**Frontend (React/Redux):**
- Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Coverage target: 80% for business logic components and utils
- Focus areas:
  - UI components (isolated)
  - Redux reducers, actions, and selectors
  - Utility functions
  - Validation logic

**Backend (Node.js/Express):**
- Framework: Mocha + Chai
- Coverage target: 85% for business logic
- Focus areas:
  - Controllers
  - Services
  - Models
  - Utility functions
  - Middleware

### 2.2. Integration Testing

**Frontend:**
- Connected component tests (components with Redux)
- Form submission flows
- Data fetching and state updates

**Backend:**
- API endpoint tests with Supertest
- Database interactions
- Service integrations
- Authentication/Authorization flows

### 2.3. End-to-End Testing

- Framework: Cypress
- Key user journeys:
  - User registration and login
  - Browsing product catalog and filtering
  - Adding products to cart
  - Checkout process
  - Order tracking
  - Reviewing products
  - User profile management

### 2.4. API Testing

- Tool: Postman collections (automated) / Supertest
- Coverage: All API endpoints documented in the API specification
- Verification of:
  - Request/response schemas
  - Status codes
  - Error handling
  - Headers and authentication

## 3. Additional Testing Types

### 3.1. Performance Testing

- Page load times
- API response times
- Stress testing for concurrent users
- Database query optimization

### 3.2. Security Testing

- Authentication/Authorization
- Input validation
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Data encryption
- API security

### 3.3. Accessibility Testing

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast

### 3.4. Cross-browser/Cross-device Testing

- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Devices: Desktop, tablet, mobile
- Responsive design verification

## 4. Test Environment

### 4.1. Environment Setup

- Development: Local development with mock services
- Testing: Dedicated test environment with test database
- Staging: Production-like environment with anonymized data
- Production: Live environment

### 4.2. Test Data Management

- Seed data for consistent test execution
- Data cleanup after test runs
- Anonymized production data for staging tests

## 5. Test Automation Strategy

### 5.1. CI/CD Integration

- Run unit and integration tests on every PR
- Run E2E tests nightly and before releases
- Performance and security tests on scheduled intervals

### 5.2. Prioritization

1. Critical user paths (authentication, checkout)
2. Core functionality (product browsing, cart)
3. Secondary features (reviews, user preferences)

### 5.3. Test Maintenance

- Regular review of test coverage
- Update tests alongside feature development
- Flaky test identification and resolution

## 6. Bug Management

- Bug reporting template
- Severity classification
- Prioritization criteria
- Regression testing for fixed issues

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- Definition of Done includes passing all relevant tests
- Critical paths must have automated tests
- No critical or high bugs in release candidates

## 8. Reporting

- Test coverage metrics
- Test execution results
- Bug metrics (open, closed, age)
- Performance metrics over time

## 9. Tools and Frameworks

### Frontend Testing
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Redux Mock Store
- Axios Mock Adapter

### Backend Testing
- Mocha
- Chai
- Supertest
- MongoDB Memory Server

### E2E Testing
- Cypress
- Percy (visual testing)

### Performance Testing
- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest

### Accessibility Testing
- axe-core
- Lighthouse Accessibility Audit

## 10. Testing Schedule

- Unit tests: Run on every commit
- Integration tests: Run on every PR
- E2E tests: Run nightly and before releases
- Performance tests: Weekly
- Security tests: Monthly
- Accessibility audits: Before major releases

## 11. Roles and Responsibilities

- Developers: Write unit and integration tests
- QA Engineers: Write E2E tests, perform exploratory testing
- DevOps: Maintain test environments and CI/CD pipelines
- Product Managers: Define acceptance criteria
